PUNTEGGIO [ 0.1179732103645147 ]

FRASE 2: President Barack Obama dressed him down for encouraging South Korea and Japan to acquire nuclear weapons. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.697104941841784 ]

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.014492753623188404 ]

FRASE 4: Academics trying to parse Mr. Trump’s statements can’t figure out which “school” of foreign-policy thinking he belongs to. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.07352484472049689 ]

FRASE 5: (So far, my favorite scholarly comment has been: “There is no indication that Trump understands the workings of balance of power theory…” Of course, there is no indication that Mr. Trump cares about the workings of any theories—and no real danger that he subscribes to them.)
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.023411371237458192 ]

FRASE 6: The candidate’s set-to with the president, however, was far from frivolous. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.07657004830917874 ]

FRASE 7: Mr. Trump suggested that, if South Korea and Japan had nuclear weapons, we could spend less protecting those allies. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.5452173913043479 ]

FRASE 8: This approach, Mr. Obama rejoined, would reverse decades of U.S. policy on nuclear proliferation. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.10803140096618359 ]

FRASE 9: (One of the president’s aides said it would be “catastrophic.”) 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.07657004830917874 ]

FRASE 10: The president was particularly indignant after the success of last week’s Nuclear Security Summit—at which he got Poland and Kazakhstan to agree to reduce their stockpiles of enriched uranium, Japan to ship out some separated plutonium, and other participants to tighten up a treaty on securing nuclear materials.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.8609758916395073 ]

FRASE 13: In the half-century since the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was negotiated, no state has gotten nuclear weapons because materials for doing so were inadequately secured. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.5667996737561956 ]

FRASE 15: Mr. Trump is right about one thing: The big question raised by North Korea’s success in building a nuclear arsenal is whether South Korea and Japan feel obliged to follow suit.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.12831147685266678 ]

FRASE 16: There is a terrible irony in thinking through how to avoid this result. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.08755463538072233 ]

FRASE 21: No U.S. president should want them to do so—or take for granted that he or she could stop them. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.07657004830917874 ]

FRASE 22: China needs to reckon with, and be reminded of, the enormous danger it is courting. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.016770186335403725 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 24: He may do more good than he knows.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 20: Yet there is one thing that might get Beijing to do better: the Trumpian prospect that Seoul and Tokyo will decide to become nuclear powers. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 18: Beijing’s record on this issue, while improving, remains inadequate. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 17: Only one country—China—may be able to get the North Koreans to change course. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 14: For all new nuclear powers (and those countries that decided not to go nuclear, such as Germany, Ukraine, and South Africa), the decisive factor was how they saw the main threats to their own security. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 12: Yet Mr. Trump has—okay, maybe unwittingly—highlighted a question about the entire non-proliferation enterprise that is at least as important as anything that happened at Mr. Obama’s summit.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 11: These were worthy achievements. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0 ]
