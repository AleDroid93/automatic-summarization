PUNTEGGIO [ 1.1319088585336847 ]

FRASE 6: The documentary opens with the Cernan of today, complete with cowboy hat and boots, attending a rodeo and wincing as riders are thrown off the back of a real-life bucking bronco. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.20812336507825227 ]

FRASE 7: We are led to imagine, as the picture changes to one of an astronaut in a giant centrifuge, that Cernan is remembering his own training and experiences.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.7528559164958897 ]

FRASE 8: The opening credits, accompanied by plangent guitar twangs, are superimposed over pictures of a deserted launchpad, grass growing through cracks in the concrete, close-ups of rusting gantries, and, finally, the silhouette of Cernan himself (one assumes) against the skyline above a crumbling blast-pit, arms akimbo. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.31794226786127905 ]

FRASE 9: All the clichés of a western – only the tumbleweed is missing. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.11956235281091539 ]

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.5092575596303439 ]

FRASE 16: But the film is much more than a biography of Cernan; it is his account of one of the most important parts of the history of human spaceflight.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.4448141366393191 ]

FRASE 17: Cernan flew in space three times. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0881116502545074 ]

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.7125336145879845 ]

FRASE 24: Overheating from his exertions, combined with heat from the Sun, made him sweat – causing his helmet to fog upwhen the temperatured fell, which was once every 90 minutes as the capsule orbited Earth.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.3976527887208265 ]

FRASE 27: But watching the ISS astronauts carrying out their tasks half a century later, it is clear they owe an enormous debt of gratitude to pathfinders such as Cernan, who took huge risks to identify where improvements had to be made.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.7818000325295646 ]

FRASE 29: Cernan speaks with emotion of the accident that took the lives of three of his friends and colleagues, and the effect it had on the remaining astronauts.

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.48924388168771016 ]

FRASE 33: His description of the lunar landscape, his excitement at finding orange soil and travelling in the lunar rover brought out the inner astronaut in me.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.37643738031477453 ]

FRASE 34: Cernan’s first wife is an important part of the documentary, describing what it was like living in the “astronaut colony”. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 1.0903155956750856 ]

FRASE 35: Pictures of parties, barbecues and laughter are shown alongside footage of the Apollo 1 disaster, showing how close the astronauts’ wives became to each other. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.8614464811565088 ]

FRASE 36: After Apollo, Cernan travelled as a global ambassador for Nasa, and long stretches away from home eventually ruined his marriage.

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.13747846746473494 ]

FRASE 40: Footage of his young daughter explaining to a TV reporter her dad had promised to bring her back a moonbeam from his mission certainly shows paternal warmth.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.17358449253773653 ]

FRASE 41: As Neil Armstrong, the first man to walk on the moon, took “one small step” to make “a giant leap for mankind”, so Cernan marked his departure from the moon with “man’s last step from the surface”, hoping that “we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind”. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 6.355565275908319 ]

FRASE 42: Only 41 months separated the footprints made by the two men, but their achievements have echoed through the 44 years since Cernan closed the hatch on the lunar module.
PUNTEGGIO [ 1.869523771740273 ]

FRASE 43: The documentary once again reminds us of the gift the bravery of the Apollo astronauts gave us – a heritage of human spaceflight that has now enabled a much more global and co-operative space programme.

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.022959183673469385 ]

PUNTEGGIO [ 0.0675065532187958 ]

FRASE ELIMINATA 21: Cernan’s spacewalk was a solo effort, with a hugely long “umbilical cord” attaching him to the spacecraft, which kept getting in the way of his manoeuvres.
