FRASE 3: The brokerage on Wednesday cut its 2016 and 2017 fiscal year estimates for iPhone sales, citing longer upgrade cycles. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.8888888888888888 ]

FRASE 4: The move also caused it to lower its earnings projections for this year and next, and it led it to slice its price target on shares to $130 from $141, 19% above where the stock recently traded at $109.22.

FRASE 5: It’s no new news that iPhone sales are set to decline this fiscal year for the first time in the tech giant’s history.

FRASE 6: But there are broader concerns that a structural change is underway in the pace of upgrades, said Walter Piecyk of BTIG.

FRASE 7: “Upgrade rates [for all smartphones] were lower than we expected in the fourth quarter and are diving even lower in the March quarter,” wrote Mr. Piecyk in a note to clients.

FRASE 8: He looked at upgrade rates at the four big carriers — Verizon Communications, AT&T, T-Mobile US and Sprint — when compiling his data.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.6728395061728395 ]

FRASE 9: Part of the decline may have been driven by a slowdown ahead of Samsung’s Galaxy S7 launch in March and growth of iPhone sales in Apple stores, which operators might not be factoring into their upgrade rates, he said. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 1.0580808080808082 ]

FRASE 11: When it comes to Apple, specifically, people have blamed the “s” cycle for sluggish sales and longer upgrades. 
PUNTEGGIO [ 1.6933073424301495 ]

FRASE 13: However, the decline this year has been steeper than prior cycles, said Mr. Piecyk.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.6944444444444444 ]

FRASE 15: Sales of iPhone units should now hit 210 million in the current fiscal year and 220 million in fiscal 2017, he estimates.
PUNTEGGIO [ 0.16666666666666666 ]

FRASE 19: Even though data from phone carriers suggests the upgrade cycle is being extended, it will take a few more quarters and the launch of the next iPhone to confirm whether users are indeed keeping their outdated phones for longer, said Mr. Piecyk.

FRASE ELIMINATA 2: For Apple, that’s a concern, said BTIG.
